# Implement a design from scratch

This project is a demonstration of creating a webpage using only HTML and CSS,
based on a design template provided in Figma. The objective is to implement the webpage from scratch,
employing HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design techniques learned previously.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a fully functional webpage that closely resembles the designer file provided in Figma. The implementation should adhere to the following requirements:

- No external CSS framework, such as Bootstrap, is allowed.
- JavaScript is not permitted for this project.

## Features
HTML Structure: The webpage is structured using semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and SEO.
CSS Styling: Custom CSS rules are applied to achieve the desired layout and visual design, mirroring the Figma template.
Responsive Design: Media queries are utilized to ensure the webpage is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Accessibility: Accessibility best practices are followed to ensure the webpage is usable and navigable for all users, including those with disabilities.
